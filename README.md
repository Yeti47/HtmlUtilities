# HtmlUtilities
A PHP utility library for easily and quickly generating HTML content.
This is just a little something I threw together to simplify my work with PHP and HTML and to unify the way HTML content is produced within my PHP code.

# Usage

## Simple Html-Tags

```PHP
<?php

// Create a new instance of the HtmlTag class and pass the type of the tag as a string.
$htmlParagraph = new HtmlTag('p');


?>
```
